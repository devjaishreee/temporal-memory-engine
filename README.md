#  Temporal Memory Update Engine

A lightweight memory architecture for tracking **evolving user state over time**. Built for AI agents that adapt as users change. Whether you're building chatbots, recommender systems, or lifelike companions, this engine ensures your agent remembers *what matters now*, not just what mattered once.

---

##  Why Use This?

- Does your user say "I like sushi" today, and "I prefer ramen" tomorrow?
- Want to track such shifts, keep only the latest preference active, and still preserve history?

This engine helps your system:
-  Store and overwrite memories with timestamps
-  Maintain a full history of changes
-  Always operate on the latest, contextually relevant state

Perfect for **agentic AI**, **personal assistants**, and **dynamic UX systems**.

## Features

-  **Key-Value Memory Store** â€“ Lightweight, intuitive storage engine.
-  **Timestamped Updates** â€“ Every update is time-aware.
-  **Version History** â€“ Keep a record of evolving states.
-  **Simple Overwrite Logic** â€“ Old values archived automatically.
-  **Modular & Extensible** â€“ Plug it into larger memory or graph-based architectures.

##  Example

```python
from memory_engine.memory_store import MemoryStore

mem = MemoryStore()
mem.set("food_preference", "sushi")
mem.set("food_preference", "ramen")

print(mem.get("food_preference"))     # ramen
print(mem.get_history("food_preference"))
```
